You can use the conveyer's methods via instance or result.

You can also use scroll-related functions through methods.


### scrollIntoView
[`.scrollIntoView`](/docs/api/Conveyer#scrollIntoView) method scrolls an element or an item in that direction into the view.

Also, if the `intersection` option is enabled, items overlapping on the side can also be included in the target.


import Intersection from "@site/src/examples/Intersection";
import { ScrollIntoViewTargetWithIntersection } from "@site/src/examples/ScrollIntoViewTarget";
import ConveyerCodeTabs from "@site/docs/codes/ConveyerCodeTabs";

<ScrollIntoViewTargetWithIntersection />


### Example

* If you click the `prev` button, you can align the items in the `start`(target) direction to `end`(align).
* If you click the `next` button, you can align the items in the `end`(target) direction to `start`(align).
